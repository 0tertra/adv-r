# Databases and sql

You access elements of a database through SQL.  [9.7.8](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/HTML/node67.html#SECTION001378000000000000000) gives the basics, and you'll learn other useful functions when working through the homework.  The R import/export manual also has some good general information about [relational databases](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-data.html#Relational-databases).

Focus on extracting information from databases, rather than creating them and the finer points of index optimisation.  Focus on ANSI SQL
