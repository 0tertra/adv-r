Compared to S3, the S4 object system is much stricter, and much closer to other OO systems. I recommend you familiarise yourself with the way that [[S3]] works before reading this document - many of underlying ideas are the same, but the implementation is much stricter.

There are two major differences from S3:

  * multiple dispatch: the generic function can be dispatched to a method
    based on the class of any number of argument, not just one

  * formal class definitions: unlike S3, S4 formally defines the
    representation and inheritance for each class

Here we introduce the basics of S4, trying to stay away from the esoterica and focussing on the ideas that you need to understand and write the majority of S4 code. If you would like to learn more, consult one of the more detailed resources such as: ...

# Defining classes

In S3, you can turn any object into an object of a particular class just by setting the class attribute.  S4 is much stricter: you must define the representation of the call using `setClass`, and the only way to create it is through the constructer function `new`.

    setClass(name, 
      representation, prototype,
      contains)

    new(name, values)
    initialize

Can also define an optional method that applies additional restrictions. This function can also be specified in `setClass`.

    setValidity()

Accessing slots:

    @
    getSlot
    getSlots

# Defining methods

Generic functions and methods work similarly to S3, but dispatch is based on the class of all arguments, and there is a special syntax for creating both generic functions and new methods.

    setGeneric(name, definition)
    setMethod(method_name, signature, definition)

## Inheritance

 * callNextMethod
 * inheritance
 * setIs

## Common methods

  * is, as as<-
