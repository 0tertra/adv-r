Compared to S3, the S4 object system is much stricter, and much closer to other OO systems. I recommend you familiarise yourself with the way that [[S3]] works before reading this document - many of underlying ideas are the same, but the implementation is much stricter.

There are two major differences from S3:

  * multiple dispatch: the generic function can be dispatched to a method
    based on the class of any number of argument, not just one

  * formal class definitions: unlike S3, S4 formally defines the
    representation and inheritance for each class

Here we introduce the basics of S4, trying to stay away from the esoterica and focussing on the ideas that you need to understand and write the majority of S4 code. If you would like to learn more, consult one of the more detailed resources such as: ...

# Defining classes

In S3, you can turn any object into an object of a particular class just by setting the class attribute.  S4 is much stricter: you must define the representation of the call using `setClass`, and the only way to create it is through the constructer function `new`.

A class has three key properties:

  * a __name__: an alpha-numeric string that identifies the class

  * __representation__: a list of __slots__ (or attributes), giving their
    names and classes. For example, a person class might be represented a
    character name and a numeric age, as follows: 
    `representation(name = "character", age = "numeric")`

  * a character vector of classes that it inherits from, or in S4 terminology,
    __contains__

You create a class with `setClass`:

    setClass("Person", representation(name = "character", age = "numeric"))
    setClass("Employee", representation(boss = "Person"), contains = "Person")

and create an instance of a class with `new`:

    hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = 31)

Unlike S3, S4 checks that all of the slots have the correct type:
    
    hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = "thirty")
    # Error in validObject(.Object) : 
    #  invalid class "Person" object: invalid object for slot "age" in class
    #  "Person": got class "character", should be or extend class "numeric"
    
    hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley", sex = "male")
    # Error in initialize(value, ...) : 
    # invalid names for slots of class "Person": sex
    
If you omit a slot, it will initiate it with the default object of the class.  Note that to access slots of an S4 object you use `@`, not `$`.

    hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley")
    hadley@age
    # numeric(0)
    
This is likely not what you want, so you can also assign a default __prototype__ for the class:

    setClass("Person", representation(name = "character", age = "numeric"), 
      prototype(name = NA_character_, age = NA_real_))
    hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley")
    hadley@age
    # [1] NA

To access a slot given by a string you can use `slot`, and `getSlots` will return a description of all the slots of a clas:

  slot(hadley, "name")
  # [1] "Hadley"

  getSlots("Person")
  #        name         age 
  # "character"   "numeric" 

You can also provide an optional method that applies additional restrictions. This function should have a single argument called `object` and should return `TRUE` if the object is valid, and if not it should return a character vector giving all reasons it is not valid.

    check_person <- function(object) {
      errors <- character()
      length_age <- length(object@age)
      if (length_age != 1) {
        msg <- paste("Age is length ", length_age, ".  Should be 1", sep = "")
        errors <- c(errors, msg)
      }

      length_name <- length(object@name)
      if (length_name != 1) {
        msg <- paste("Name is length ", length_name, ".  Should be 1", sep = "")
        errors <- c(errors, msg)
      }
      
      if (length(errors) == 0) TRUE else errors
    }
    setClass("Person", representation(name = "character", age = "numeric"), 
      validity = check_person)
    
    new("Person", name = "Hadley")
    # invalid class "Person" object: Age is length 0.  Should be 1
    new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = 1:10)
    Error in validObject(.Object) : 
      invalid class "Person" object: Age is length 10.  Should be 1
      
    # But note that the check is not automatically applied when we modify 
    # slots directly
    hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = 31)
    hadley@age <- 1:10
    
    # Can force check with validObject:
    validObject(hadley)
    # invalid class "Person" object: Age is length 10.  Should be 1

There's some tension between the usual interactive functional style of R and the global side-effect causing S4 class definitions. In most programming languages, class definition occurs at compile-time, while object instantiation occurs at run-time - it's unusual to be able to create new classes interactively.  In particular, note that multiple calls to `setClass` with the same class name will silently override the previous definition unless the first definition is sealed with `sealed = TRUE`.

# Defining methods

Generic functions and methods work similarly to S3, but dispatch is based on the class of all arguments, and there is a special syntax for creating both generic functions and new methods.

    setGeneric(name, definition)
    setMethod(method_name, signature, definition)
