# Introduction

This book has grown out of over 10 years of programming in R, and constantly struggling to understand the best way of doing things. I would particularly like to thank the tireless contributors to R-help. There are too many that have helped me over the years to list individually, but I'd particularly like to thank Luke Tierney and Brian Ripley for correcting countless of my misunderstandings and helping me to deeply understand R.

R is still a relatively young language, and the resources to help you understand it are still maturing. In my personal journey to understand R, I've found it particularly helpful to refer to resources that describe how other programming languages work.  I found the following two books particularly helpful:

* The structure and interpretation of computer programs.

* P. van Roy and S. Haridi. Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming. The MIT Press, 2004.

Other websites that helped me to understand smaller pieces of R are:

* [Getting Started with Dylan](http://www.opendylan.org/gdref/tutorial.html)
  for understanding S4

The basics of R that I think you should know.  

## Functions

* argument matching: exact, partial, position
* ...
* recursion (+ recall)
* copy on modify
* returning multiple objects
* binary operators
* replacement functions

## Important functions

 * lapply
 * sapply / vapply

## Data structures

## Subsetting
