# Advanced R topics

In the these topics I try and explain how fundamental R components work, taking the [R language definition][lang-def] and trying to make it more user friendly with plenty of examples to illustrate each idea.

  * [[The S3 object system|S3]]
  * [[Closures]]
  * [[Scoping]]
  * Lazy evaluation: default, delayedAssign, autoload, makeActiveBinding
  * Computing on the language: calls, expressions, functions

# Good development practices

The following documents give my opinionated beliefs on good development practice, distilled from my experience writing over 20 R packages.

  * [[Introduction to namespaces|Namespaces]] for use with roxygen
  * [[Testing]]
