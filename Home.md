This is the in-progress book site for "Advanced R development: making reusable code".  It is broken into two sections:

* __Advanced R programming__: learn all about how the R language works and how you can use it to solve real problems. 

* __Package development__: Packages are the fundamental unit of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. In this section you'll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first, but start with the basics and then improve it over time. It doesn't matter if your first version isn't perfect as long as the next version is better.
 
It will eventually be published as a real book with Chapman and Hall (the final version is due December 2013, so it should be available in early 2014). Thanks to the agreement of the publisher, this wiki will continue to be freely available after the book is published.
