# Advanced R development

## Specialised data types and languages

These types of data come up so frequently it's useful to know a little about them and the specialised languages that you use to work with them:

  * Strings and regular expressions
  * Databases and SQL
  * XML and XPath

## Advanced R topics

In the following pages I try and explain how fundamental R components work, taking the [R language definition][lang-def] and making it easier to understand with plenty of examples to illustrate each idea.

  * [[The S3 object system|S3]]
  * [[The S4 object system|S4]]
  * Other object systems
  * [[Scoping, environments and closures|Scoping]]
  * [[Controlling evaluation|Evaluation]]
  * [[Lazy evaluation|Lazy-evaluation]]
  * [[Computing on the language|Computing-on-the-language]]
  * [[Exceptions and debugging|Exceptions-debugging]]

## Developing a package

Learn how to get started with a package in [[package basics]], and then read up on the following topics to master package development:

  * [[well tested||Testing]]
  * clearly [[documented|Documentation]]
  * readable, with well defined [[style]]
  * uses [[namespaces]] to minimise conflict with other packages
  * [[source code control|git]]: git + github
  * [[ready for release|Release]]

## Miscellaneous

* [[How to make a reproducible example|Reproducibility]]
* [[A philosophy of data|data-philosophy]]
* Mastering the command line
