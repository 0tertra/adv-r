Central to any object-oriented language are the concepts of class and of methods. A __class__ is a definition of an object, and typically a class contains several elements that hold class-specific details. Every object must be an instance of some class. A __method__ is a function specialised for dealing with a particular class of object.

R implements a type of object orientedness called generic functions. This is different to most programming languages, like Java, C++ and C#, which implement message-passing OO. In message-passing style, messages are sent to objects and the object determines which function to call. This means that the method selection is based on the class of object to which the message is sent, not the class of any other parameters. Typically this object has a special appearance in the method call, usually appearing before the name of the method/message: `canvas.drawRect("blue")`.  With generic functions, computations are still carried out via methods, but rather than the object choosing which method to call, a special type of function called a __generic function__ decides. In R, methods are defined just like a normal function, but are called in a different way. 

The greatest use of OO programming in R is for print, summary and plot methods. These methods allow us to have one generic function call, e.g. `print()`, that displays the object differently typing on its type. To do this, each model attaches a class attribute to its output and then provides a special method that takes that output and provides a nice readable version of it. The user then needs only remember that print or summary will provide nice output for the results of any analysis.

# Object class

The class of an object is determined by its class attribute, a character vector of class names. For example, to create an object of class foo you just set the class attribute to a vector that contains "foo": 

    x <- 1
    attr(x, "class") <- "foo"
    x
    
    # Or all in one line
    x <- structure(1, class = "foo")
    x
  
This means virtually anything can be turned in to an object of class "foo" (whether it makes sense or not!).

An object can have more than one class:

    attr(x, "class") <- c("a", "b")
  
As you'll learn in the next section, methods are looked for in the order in which they appear in the class vector. So in this example, it would be like class A inherits from class B - if a method isn't defined for A, it will fall back to B. However, if you switched the order of the classes, the opposite would be true!

This is because S3 doesn't have any formal relationship between classes, or even any definition of what an individual class is. If you're coming from a stricter environment like Java, this will seem pretty frightening (and it is!) but it also gives the user a tremendous amount of freedom. It makes it very difficult to stop someone from doing something you don't want them to do, but on the other hand, your users will never be held back because there is something you haven't implemented yet.

# Generic functions and method dispatch

Method dispatch starts with a generic function, which decides which method the job should be dispatched to. Generic functions all have the same form: a call to `UseMethod` that specifies the generic name, and the object to dispatch on. This means that generic functions are usually very simple, like `mean`:

     mean <- function (x, ...) {
       UseMethod("mean", x)
     }

The first argument to `mean` is special because `UseMethod` uses it to figure out which method should be called as follows.  Suppose that x had a class of `c("foo","bar")`. Then `UseMethod` would search first for a function called `mean.foo` and if it didn't find it, it would then look for `mean.bar`. If it couldn't find that either, it would try `mean.default`, and if that didn't exist it would raise an error. The same approach applies regardless of how many classes an object has:

    x <- structure(1, class = letters)
    bar <- function(x) UseMethod("bar", x)
    bar.z <- function(x) "z"
    bar(x)
    # [1] "z"

Once a method has been determined `UseMethod` invokes it in a special way. Rather than creating a new evaluation environment, it uses the environment of the current function call (the call to the generic), so any assignments or evaluations that were made before the call to UseMethod will be accessible to the method. The arguments that were used in the call to the generic are rematched to the formal arguments of the method.

# Inheritance

`NextMethod` is used to provide a simple inheritance mechanism. Commonly a specific method performs a few operations to set up the data and then it calls the next appropriate method through a call to `NextMethod`. A function may have a call to `NextMethod` anywhere in it - this works like `UseMethod` but instead of dispatching on the first element of the class vector, it will dispatch based on the second element:

    baz <- function(x) UseMethod("baz", x)
    baz.A <- function(x) "A"
    baz.B <- function(x) "B"

    ab <- structure(1, class = c("A", "B"))
    ba <- structure(1, class = c("B", "B"))
    baz(ab)
    baz(ba)

    baz.C <- function(x) NextMethod()
    ca <- structure(1, class = c("C", "A"))
    cb <- structure(1, class = c("C", "B"))
    baz(ca)
    baz(cb)

The exact details are a little tricky: `NextMethod` doesn't actually work with the class attribute of the object, it uses a global variable (`.Class`) to keep track of which class to call next. This means that manually changing the class of the object will have no impact on the inheritance. The following example illustrates this:

    # Turn object into class A - doesn't work!
    baz.D <- function(x) {
      class(x) <- "A"
      NextMethod()
    }
    da <- structure(1, class = c("D", "A"))
    db <- structure(1, class = c("D", "B"))
    baz(da)
    baz(db)

Methods invoked as a result of a call to `NextMethod` behave as if they had been invoked from the previous method. The arguments to the inherited method are in the same order and have the same names as the call to the current method. This means that they are the same as for the call to the generic. However, the expressions for the arguments are the names of the corresponding formal arguments of the current method. Thus the arguments will have values that correspond to their value at the time NextMethod was invoked.  Unevaluated arguments remain unevaluated. Missing arguments remain missing.

If `NextMethod` is called in a situation where there is no second class it will return an error.  A selection of these errors are shown below so that you know what to look for.

    c <- structure(1, class = "C")
    baz(c)
    # Error in UseMethod("baz", x) : 
    #   no applicable method for 'baz' applied to an object of class "C"
    baz.c(c)
    # Error in NextMethod() : generic function not specified
    baz.c(1)
    # Error in NextMethod() : object not specified
