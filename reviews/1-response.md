Thanks to all the reviewers for their comments - they are greatly appreciated. I've fixed the small things you pointed out, and I'm still working on many of the bigger issues (i.e. structure changes). 

Splitting the book up into pieces caused a lot confusion in the last round of reviews, so this time I'm including the complete book, but please focus on the functional programming chapters, chapters 4, 5 and 6. The biggest change to the book as a whole is that I've dropped the chapters on package development - those will eventually go into their own volume. Thinking that this would be a 150 page book was terribly optimistic :/

The book is currently generated from markdown so lacks much of the final latex formatting. Those will be added once the book gets closer to the final form (which is also when copy-editing will occur!) However, in this version, I've tried to add some extra structure (parts and appendices) to make it more clear how the book will hang together as a whole.
