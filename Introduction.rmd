# Introduction

I have been programming in R for over 10 years, spending a lot of time trying to figure out how the language works. Not everyone has the luxury of spending years to understand a programming language, so this book is my attempt to help you to become an effective R programmer as quickly as possible. By reading this book, you will avoid the many mistakes that I made and the many dead ends that I got stuck in, and quickly navigate your way to useful tools and techniques. Although R has its frustrating quirks, I truly believe that at its heart lies an elegant and beautiful language, well tailored for data analysis and statistics. In this book, I'll do my best to reveal that language to you, helping you to understand powerful idioms that allow you to attack many types of problems.

If you are new to R, you might wonder what makes learning such a quirky language worthwhile. To me, some of the best features of R are:

* It is free, open source and easily available on every major platform:
  if you do your analysis in R, anyone else can replicate it for free.

* A massive set of packages for statistical modelling, machine learning, 
  visualisation, data import and data manipulation. Whatever model or 
  visualisation you're trying to do, the chances are that someone has tried
  to do it before and you can learn from their efforts. 
  
* Researchers in statistics and machine learning will often publish an
  R package to accompany their research articles. That means you can use
  cutting edge research as soon as it's avaiable.

* Deep features of the language support data analysis. These included missing 
  values, data frames, and subsetting.

* A fantastic community. It is easy to get help from experts on the 
  [R-help mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help), 
  [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r),
  or subject specific mailing lists like 
  [R-SIG-mixed-models](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mixed-models)
  or [ggplot2](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ggplot2). You 
  can also connect with other R learners via 
  [twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats),
  [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/R-Project-Statistical-Computing-77616),
  and throuh many local 
  [user groups](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html).

* Powerful tools for communicating your results. R packages make it easy to
  produce html or pdf [reports](http://yihui.name/knitr/), or create 
  [interactive websites](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/).

* A strong functional programming foundation. The ideas of functional 
  programming are well suited to solving many data analysis challenges and 
  the tools in R give you a powerful and flexible toolkit which allows you
  write concise yet descriptive code.

* An [IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) tailored to the needs of interactive
  data analysis and statistical programming.

* Powerful metaprogramming facilities. R is not just a programming language,
  but it is also an environment for interactive data analysis. Metaprogramming
  makes it possible to write succinct functions that are a little magical 
  in their ability to reduce the amount of typing you need. R also provides an 
  excellent environment for designing domain specific languages.

* R is designed to connect to high-performance programming languages like C,
  Fortran and C++.

Of course, R is not perfect. R's biggest challenge is that most R users are not programmers. This means that:

* Much R code you'll see in the wild is not very elegant, fast or easy to 
  understand. It's usually written in haste to solve a pressing problem, and 
  has not been rewritten for clarity, elegance or performance.

* Compared to other programming languages, the R community tends to be more
  focussed on results, not processes. Knowledge of software engineering 
  best practices is patchy, not enough R programmers use source code control
  or automated testing.

* Metaprogramming is a double-edged sword, and too many R functions use
  tricks to reduce the amount of typing at the cost of making code that
  is hard to understand and that fails in unexpected ways.

* Inconsistency is rife across contributed packages and even within base R. 
  The R APIs have evolved over 20 years, and you are confronted with 
  that fact every time you use R. Having to memorise many special cases 
  makes learning R tough.

* R is not a particularly fast programming language, and poorly written R code
  can be terribly slow. R is also a profligate user of memory, and tools for
  parallel processing are not mature.

Personally, I think these challenges are great opportunities for experienced programmers to have a profound positive impact on the R community. R users do care about writing high quality code, particularly for reproducible research, but they don't yet have the skills to do it. I hope this book will help more R users to become R programmers, and encourage programmers from other languages to contribute to R.

## Who should read this book

This book is aimed at two complementary audiences:

* Intermediate R programmers who want to dive deeper into R and learn more 
  strategies for solving diverse problems

* Programmers from other languages who are learning R, and want to understand 
  why R works the way it does.

To get the most out of this book, you will need to have written a decent amount of code in either R or other programming languages. You should be familiar with how functions work in R, although you might not know all the details, and you should be somewhat familiar with the apply family of functions (like `apply()` and `lapply()`), although you may currently struggle to use them effectively.

## What you will get out of this book

This book describes the skills that I think you need to be an advanced R programmer, producing reusable code that can be used in a wide variety of circumstances.

After reading this book, you will:

* Be familiar with the fundamentals of R, so that you can understand complex 
  data types and simplify the operations performed on them. You will have a 
  deep understanding of how functions work, and be able to recognise and use
  the four object systems in R. 

* Understand what functional programming means, and why it is useful tool
  for data analysis. You'll be able to use many existing new tools, and
  have the knowledge to create your own new functional tools when needed.
  
* Appreciate the double-edged sword of metaprogramming. You'll be able to 
  create functions that use non-standard evaluation in a principled way, 
  saving typing and creating elegant languages for expressing important 
  operations. You'll also understand the dangers of metaprogramming, 
  why you should be careful about its use.

* Have a good intuition for what operations in R are slow, or use a lot of 
  memory. You'll know how to use profiling to pinpoint performance 
  bottlenecks, and you'll know enough C++ to convert slow R functions to 
  fast C++ equivalents.

* Be comfortable reading and understanding the majority of R code.  
  You'll recognise common idioms (even if you wouldn't use them yourself) 
  and be able to critique others' code.

## Meta-techniques

There are two meta-techniques that are tremendously helpful for improving your skills as an R programmer: reading the source, and adopting a scientific mindset.

Reading source code is a tremendously useful technique because it exposes you to new ways of doing things. Over time you'll develop a sense of taste as an R programmer, and even if you find something your taste violently objects to, it's still helpful: emulate the things you like and avoid the things you don't like. I think the clarity of my code increased considerably once I started grading code in the classroom, and was exposed to a lot of code I couldn't make heads nor tails of! I think it's a great idea to start by reading the source code for the functions and packages that you use most frequently. Reading the source becomes even more important when you start using more esoteric parts of R; often the documentation will be lacking, and you'll need to figure out how a function works by reading the source and experimenting.

A scientific mindset is extremely helpful when learning R. If you don't understand how something works, develop a hypothesis, design some experiments, run them and record the results. This exercise is extremely useful if you can't figure it out and need to get help from others: you can easily show what you tried, and when you learn the right answer, you'll be mentally prepared to update your world view. I often find that when I clearly describe a problem to someone else (the art of creating a [reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269)), I figure out the solution myself.

## Recommended reading

R is still a relatively young language, and the resources to help you understand it are still maturing. In my personal journey to understand R, I've found it particularly helpful to refer to resources from other programming languages. R has aspects of both functional and object-oriented (OO) programming languages, and learning how these aspects are expressed in R will help you translate your existing knowledge from other programming languages, and to help you identify areas where you can improve.

To understand why R's object systems work the way they do, I found [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (SICP), by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, particularly helpful.  It is a concise but deep book, and after reading it I felt for the first time that I could actually design my own object-oriented system. It was my first introduction to the generic function style of OO common in R, and it helped me understand its strengths and weaknesses. SICP also talks a lot about functional programming, and how to create functions that are simple in isolation, but powerful in combination.

To understand the tradeoffs that R has made compared to other programming languages, I found [Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming](http://amzn.com/0262220695?tag=devtools-20) by Peter van Roy and Sef Haridi, extremely helpful. It helped me understand that R's copy-on-modify semantics make it substantially easier to reason about code, and while the current implementation in R is not very efficient, that it is a solvable problem.

If you want to learn to be a better programmer, there's no place better to turn than [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://amzn.com/020161622X?tag=devtools-20), by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. This book is program language agnostic, and provides great advice for how to be a better programmer.

## Getting help

Currently, there are two main venues to get help when you are stuck and can't figure out what's causing the problem: [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and the R-help mailing list. You can get fantastic help in both venues, but they do have their own culture and expectations. It's usually a good idea to spend a little time lurking, and learning about community expectations before your first post. 

Some good general advice:

* Make sure you have the latest version of R, and the package (or packages)
  you are having problems with. It may be that your problem is the result of 
  a bug that has been fixed recently.

* Spend some time creating a 
  [reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269). This 
  is often a useful process in its own right, because in the course of making 
  the problem reproducible you figure out what's causing the problem.

* Look for related problems before posting. If someone has already asked 
  the question and been answered, it's much faster for everyone if you use
  the existing answer.

## Acknowledgements {#intro-ack}

I would like to thank the tireless contributors to R-help and, more recently, [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r). There are too many to name individually, but I'd particularly like to thank Luke Tierney, John Chambers, Dirk Eddelbuettel, JJ Allaire and Brian Ripley for giving deeply of their time and correcting my countless misunderstandings.

This book was [written in the open](https://github.com/hadley/adv-r/), and chapters were advertised on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) when complete. It is truly a community effort: many people read the drafts, fixed typos, suggested improvements and contributed content. Without those contributors, the book wouldn't be nearly as good as it is, and I'm deeply grateful for their help.

(Before final version, remember to use `git shortlog` to list all contributors)
