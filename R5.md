# The R5 object system

<!-- http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/methods/ReferenceClasses -->

R has three object oriented (OO) systems: [[S3]], [[S4]] and [[R5]]. This page describes R5, the newest reference based .

R5, or reference classes, are brand new in R 2.12.  They fill a long standing need for mutable objects that had previously been filled by non-core packages like `R.oo`, `proto` and `mutatr`.

There are two main differences between R5 and S3/S4:

  * R5 objects use message-passing OO
  * R5 objects are mutable: the usual R copy on modify semantics do not apply

Surprisingly, the implementation of R5 is almost entirely in R code - they are a combination of S4 methods and environments.

    setRefClass(Class, fields)
    
Inheritance: `setRefClass(Class, contains )`


Adding new methods after creation: `obj$methods`
Adding new fields after creation: `obj$fields`

Note: collation
Note: namespaces and exporting
Note: documentation

Note: using reference based classes: want to minimise side effects.  Encapsulate.  Majority of functions should still be side effect free.
