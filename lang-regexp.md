# Strings and regular expressions

If you're not familiar with regular expressions, [Chapter 11](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/HTML/node82.html) of IDT has a good introduction. Remember that the regular expression is not the same as the string that represents it. To get the regular expression `a\.b`, in R you need `"a\\.b"`. Use `cat()` to print out the string, not the way you'd create it.
