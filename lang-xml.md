# XML and XPath

The equivalent of regular expressions for xml is xpath.  IDT has a very brief introduction, [7.3.1](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/HTML/node52.html), and you can find more in depth information [elsewhere](http://www.w3schools.com/XPath/xpath_syntax.asp). Familiarise yourself with both of these resources; while xpath is a complex language, we only need to know a little to be useful. To learn how to load XML into R and extract xpath expressions, read [9.7.7](http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/HTML/node67.html#section:rxml).

# CSS selectors

Another useful resource is the JS bookmarklet [selectorgadget](http://www.selectorgadget.com/), that allows you to interactively build up a CSS selector.  CSS selectors aren't quite the same as XPath (you'll notice they're generally much more succinct), and aren't currently supported in R, but you can convert them to XPath using the built in converter, or the [css2xpath app](http://css2xpath.appspot.com/).
